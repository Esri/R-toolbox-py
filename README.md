Name: R-toolbox-py Description: Using Python as a medium to call R
functionality within ArcGIS.  The repository contains an ArcGIS Toolbox and
two example scripts (Point Clustering and Logistic Regression)

# R-toolbox-py

This toolbox contains a framework for using R (The R Project for Statistical
Computing) in ArcGIS 10 and 10.1. This is the third version of the toolbox.
This release improves the IO hook between Python and R, allowing for R message
output in the ArcGIS Results Window. This version also solves an issue with a
name change in regards to the R module that computes Logistic Regression.
Lastly, it is very important that you follow the guidelines in the
INSTALLDOC.doc.
